# IPv6 Forum IPE Council Proof of Concept (PoC)
---
### IPv6 Forum's IPE Council PoC Topics
- **Rationale**
- **IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council potential PoC Topics list**
- **Addressing a PoC Topics in a PoC Project**
- **Feeding back the PoC result**

**Rationale**

IPv6 Forum's IPE Council PoC Topics are specific areas, often linked to a Work Item, where input or feedback from the IPE Council Proofs of Concept (PoCs) is needed. IPE Council PoC Topics help to focus PoC Projects on the most relevant topics for the IPv6 Forum's IPE Council, and to increase the relevance of their contributions.

IPE Council PoC Topics are identified and documented by IPv6 Forum's IPE Council. IPE Council PoC Topics may include templates for the PoC Contributions and deadlines to ensure that the PoC Contributions arrive on-time to be taken into account by the targeted IPv6 Forum's IPE Council WIs. 

Addressing a PoC Topics in a PoC Project
IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council PoC Teams specify the targeted PoC Topic(s) in their PoC Proposal and commit to provide the expected input or feedback in the requested format (template, if applicable) in a timely manner. 

Feeding back the PoC result
As soon as experimental results relevant for a given IPE Council PoC Topic are available (no need to wait for the IPE Council PoC Project to be completed), the PoC Team creates a contribution and informs the IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council by email (if the PoC Topic had a specific template for feedback contributions, it should be used). PoC Teams are also encouraged to contribute additional results and lessons learned, outcome, and best practices during the PoC Project to the IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council. 

**IPv6 Forum's IPE Council potential PoC Topics candidates**

As described in the IPE Council PoC Framework, a PoC Team proposal shall address at least one goal relevant to IPv6 Forum's IPE Council i.e. related with an IPE Council Use Cases, an IPE Council Requirements or the suitability of an IPE Council System Architecture aspect. The output of the PoC should provide feedback to the IPv6 Forum's IPE Council that should support the improvement of the output of the existing IPE Council WIs or the creation of new WIs to address identified gaps or new topics deemed of high interest to the Industry. Alignment with existing activities is required. See table below.

**Addressing a PoC Topics in a PoC Project**

IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council PoC Teams specify the targeted PoC Topic(s) in their PoC Proposal and commit to provide the expected input or feedback in the requested format (template, if applicable) in a timely manner. 

**Feeding back the PoC result**

As soon as experimental results relevant for a given IPE Council PoC Topic are available (no need to wait for the IPE Council PoC Project to be completed), the PoC Team creates a contribution and informs the IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council by email (if the PoC Topic had a specific template for feedback contributions, it should be used). PoC Teams are also encouraged to contribute additional results and lessons learned, outcome, and best practices during the PoC Project to the IPv6 Forum’s IPE Council.
